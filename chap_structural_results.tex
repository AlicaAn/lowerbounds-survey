This chapter shall be devoted to looking at some structural results on arithmetic circuits. This would help us understand the relevance of shallow circuits in the context of proving lower bounds for arithmetic circuits of arbitrary depth. 

\section{Homogenization}\label{sec:homogenization}

Suppose we have an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial computed by an arithmetic circuit $C$. How large can the degree of intermediate computations be? Potentially, intermediate computations can involve very high degree terms which somehow cancel each other at the root. However, the following lemma of Strassen shows that we may assume without much loss of generality that arithmetic circuits never compute polynomials of degree more than the output. 

\begin{definition}[Homogeneous circuits]
A circuit $C$ is said to be \emph{homogeneous} if every gate in the circuit computes a homogeneous polynomial. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Homogenization]\label{lem:homogenization}
Let $f$ be an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial computed by a circuit $C$ of size $s$. Then, for every $0\leq i \leq d$, there is a \emph{homogeneous arithmetic circuit} $C_i'$, of size at most $O(sd^2)$, that computes the degree $i$ homogeneous polynomial in $i$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Assume without loss of generality that the circuit $C$ has all gates with fan-in at most $2$. 
For every gate $g\in C$, define $(d+1)$ gates $g^{(0)},\dots, g^{(d)}$; we shall construct a new circuit $C'$ such that $g^{(i)}$ computes the degree $i$ homogeneous part of the polynomial computed at $g$. If $g$ has children $h_1$ and $h_2$, then $C'$ would have the following connections depending on the type of the gate $g$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{$g = h_1 + h_2$}\quad\implies\quad g^{(i)} &=& h_1^{(i)} \spaced{+} h_2^{(i)}\quad\text{for all $i$}\\
\text{$g = h_1 \times h_2$}\quad\implies\quad g^{(i)} &=& \sum_{j=0}^i h_1^{(j)} h_2^{(i-j)}\quad\text{for all $i$}
\end{eqnarray*}
It is easy to check that the size of the circuit $C'$ is at most $O(sd^2)$, and computes all the homogeneous components of $f$. 
\end{proof}

Thus, for arithmetic circuits, we can assume without much loss of generality that we are working with a homogeneous circuit. 

\begin{remark*}
For the class of arithmetic formulas, it is not clear if we can homogeneous without loss of generality. If we were to apply the above lemma to an arbitrary arithmetic formula, the resulting object is a homogeneous circuit and not a formula. It is unclear if any formula can be homogenized without loss of generality. The same is the case even for constant depth circuits, as the above construction does not preserve the depth of the circuit. 

However, the class of ABPs can also be assumed to be homogeneous without loss of generality. We leave this as an exercise. 
\end{remark*}

\begin{exercise}
Prove a similar homogenization lemma for arithmetic branching programs. 
\end{exercise}

\section{Depth reduction}

The phenomenon of simulating an arbitrary arithmetic circuit by a \emph{shallow} arithmetic circuit is called \emph{depth reduction}. Arithmetic circuits exhibit some remarkable depth reduction results, and we shall go over these in this section. 

\subsection{Depth reduction for arithmetic formulas}

The depth reduction for formulas is quite easy to describe. This would also serve as step towards understanding the depth reduction for arithmetic circuits. The following depth reduction is due to Brent~\cite{brent74}. 

\begin{lemma}[\cite{brent74}]\label{lem:formula-depth-reduction}
Let $f$ be an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial computed by an arithmetic formula $\Phi$ of size $s$. Then, $f$ can also be computed by a formula $\Phi'$ of size $s' = \poly(s,n,d)$ and depth $O(\log s)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Assume without loss of generality that $\Phi$ is a formula of fan-in $2$. Starting from the root, walk down to the leaves by always taking the child with a larger sub-tree under it. Consider the first node in this path $v$ such that the size of the formula rooted at $v$ is smaller than $\frac{2s}{3}$. Let $\Phi_v$ refer to the sub-formula rooted at $v$. By the choice of the path from the root, we have
\[
\frac{s}{3} \spaced{\leq} \abs{\Phi_v} \spaced{<} \frac{2s}{3}.
\]
Let $\hat{\Phi}_v$ denote the formula where the sub-formula at $v$ is replaced by a fresh variable $y$. Since we are dealing with formulas, $\hat{\Phi}_v$ is a linear polynomial in the variable $y$. Hence,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\Phi}_v(y) & = & A \cdot y \spaced{+} B\\
\text{and,}\quad \Phi & = & A \cdot \Phi_v \spaced{+} B
\end{eqnarray*}
for some polynomials $A$ and $B$. But we can compute both $A$ and $B$ from $\hat{\Phi}_v(y)$ as
\begin{eqnarray*}
A & = & \hat{\Phi}_v(1) - \hat{\Phi}_v(0)\\
B & = & \hat{\Phi}_v(0)
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus, 
\[
f \quad = \quad (\hat{\Phi}_v(1) - \hat{\Phi}_v(0))\cdot \Phi_v \spaced{+} \hat{\Phi}_v(0)
\]
All the formulas in the above equation have size at most $\frac{2s}{3}$. Thus, by recursively applying this process on each of these sub-formulas, we obtain an $O(\log s)$ depth formula of size $\poly(s)$ as claimed. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Depth reduction for arithmetic circuits}

The key point in the above depth reduction was that for any node $v$, the formulas $\Phi_v$ and $\hat{\Phi}_v(y)$ were disjoint. This however is not the case for general arithmetic circuits. Thus, it is not clear if we can find a node in the circuit such that the subcircuit under it has size between $s/3$ and $2s/3$. However, we do not really need to make the subcircuits have size drop by a constant factor, but any parameter dropping by a constant factor would be okay. One parameter that we could work with instead is the \emph{degree}. Valiant, Skyum, Berkowitz and Rackoff \cite{vsbr83} showed that one could achieve a similar depth reduction for general circuits. This section shall be devoted to the proof of their remarkable theorem.\footnote{The proof described here follows the structure of a subsequent result \cite{ajmv98}, and not the original proof.}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{vsbr83}]
Let $f$ be an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial computed by an arithmetic circuit $\Phi$ of size $s$. Then, there is an arithmetic circuit $\Phi'$ computing $f$ and has size $s' = \poly(s,n,d)$ and depth $O(\log d)$. 
\end{theorem}

By Lemma~\ref{lem:homogenization}, we may assume without loss of generality that $\Phi$ is a homogeneous circuit. We will also assume that in $\Phi$, all multiplication gates have fan-in at most $2$ (this might increase the depth of $\Phi$ by a factor of $\log s$, but this would not hurt us). Now, we can find a similar ``1/3-2/3 separator'' as in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:formula-depth-reduction}, but based on degree instead of size. 

\begin{claim}
Let $\Phi$ be a homogeneous arithmetic circuit computing a homogeneous degree $d$ polynomial, where each multiplication gate has fan-in at most $2$. Then, there exists a node $v$ that computes a polynomial of degree $d'$ satisfying $d/3 \leq d' \leq 2d/3$. 
\end{claim}

The proof is exactly the same, except now you take a path from root to leaf by always going through the child of larger degree. What can we say about replacing the entire sub-circuit at $v$ by a new variable $y$? This runs in to some immediate problems. What if there was a node $w$ in the subcircuit at $v$, which is maybe connected to other nodes in $\Phi$? Also, the polynomial $\hat{\Phi}_v(y)$ could continue to have degree as large as $d$. Thus it is not clear if this approach would help us make progress. 

The cause of all these problems stems because the node $v$ could reached from the root through multiple paths, and hence needs to be treated with care. However, with a little more care, we can still mimic the earlier depth reduction for formulas. \\

Let us go over every gate in $\Phi$, and reorder the children so that the children are sorted in decreasing order of degrees (with the left child being the one with largest degree). We shall call such circuits as \emph{left-heavy} circuits. Note that the proof of the claim above yields such a node $v$ on the left-most path of $\Phi$. 

Since any polynomial is a sum of monomials, it would be useful to break the computation by an arbitrary circuits by a sum of smaller computations each corresponding to a monomial. The following definition does just that. 

\begin{definition}[Proof trees]\label{defn:proof-tree}
A \emph{proof tree} of an arithmetic circuit $C$ is a sub-graph $T$ obtained as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The root of $C$ is in $T$.
\item For every addition gate $g\in T$, the subgraph $T$ also contains \emph{exactly one} of its children.
\item For every multiplication gate $g\in T$, the subgraph $T$ also contains \emph{both} its children. 
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

A proof tree naturally computes a single monomial, and is a minimal witness that a certain monomial is computed in by the circuit. (It is however possible that the same monomial can be computed by multiple proof trees and there could be several cancellations.)

A very natural question at this point is why is a \emph{proof tree} a tree! It isn't clear from the above definition but note that all proof trees of a homogeneous circuit $C$ (computing a degree $d$ polynomial) computes a monomial of degree $d$. Thus, the number of multiplication gates in any proof tree is at most $d$. Thus, we may unravel any proof tree $T$ to an actual tree $T$ while not increasing the size by much. Thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that all proof trees of $C$ are unravelled to indeed be trees.
