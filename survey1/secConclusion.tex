\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
	The field of arithmetic complexity, like Boolean complexity, 
	abounds with open problems and proving lower bounds for 
	almost any natural subclass of arithmetic circuits is 
	interesting especially if the currently known techniques/
	complexity measures do not apply to that subclass\footnote{
		Some of the complexity measures that we describe here 
		yield lower bounds for slightly more general subclasses 
		of circuits.
	}. 
	The surveys \cite{aviSurvey, sy, ckw11} mark out the 
	frontiers of this area in the form of many open problems 
	and we invite the reader to try some of them.
