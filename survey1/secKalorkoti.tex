\subsection{Lower bounds for formulas}\label{sec:Kalorkoti}

This section would be devoted to the proof of Kalorkoti's lower bound
\cite{k85} for formulas computing $\Det_n$, $\Perm_n$.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{k85}]\label{thm:kalorkoti}
  Any arithmetic formula computing $\Perm_n$ (or $\Det_n$) requires
  $\Omega(n^3)$ size.
\end{theorem}

The exploitable weakness in this setting is again to use the fact that the polynomials computed at intermediate gates share many polynomial dependencies. 

\begin{definition}[Algebraic independence]
  A set of polynomials $\inbrace{f_1,\dots, f_m}$ is said to be
  \emph{algebraically independent} if there is no non-trivial polynomial 
  $H(z_1,\dots, z_m)$ such that $H(f_1,\dots, f_m)=0$. 

  The size of the largest algebraically independent subset of
  $\vecf=\inbrace{f_1,\dots, f_m}$ is called the \emph{transcendence
    degree} (denoted by $\mathrm{trdeg}(f)$).
\end{definition}

The proof of Kalorkoti's theorem proceeds by defining a \emph{complexity measure} using the above notion of algebraic independence. \\


{\bf The Measure:} 
For any subset of variables $Y\subseteq X$, we can write a polynomial
$f \in \F[X]$ of the form $f = \sum_{i=1}^s f_i \cdot m_i$ where $m_i$'s are
distinct monomials in the variables in $Y$, and $f_i \in
F[X \setminus Y]$. We shall denote by $\mathrm{td}_Y(f)$ the transcendence degree of $\inbrace{f_1,\dots, f_s}$


Fix a partition of variables $X = X_1 \sqcup \dots
\sqcup X_r$. For any polynomial $f\in \F[X]$, define the map $\CM{Kal}:\F[X]\rightarrow \Z_{\geq 0}$  as
$$
\CM{Kal}(f) \quad=\quad \sum_{i=1}^r \mathrm{td}_{X_i}(f).
$$

The lower bound proceeds in two natural steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $\CM{Kal}(f)$ is \emph{small} whenever $f$ is computable by a \emph{small} formula. 
\item Show that $\CM{Kal}(\Det_n)$ is \emph{large}. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Upper bounding $\CM{Kal}$ for a formula}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:kal-upperbound}
  Let $f$ be computed by a fan-in two formula $\Phi$ of size $s$. Then
  for any partition of variables $X = X_1\sqcup \dots \sqcup X_r$, we
  have $\CM{Kal}(f) = O(s)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For any node $v\in \Phi$, let $\textsc{Leaf}(v)$ denote the leaves
  of the subtree rooted at $v$ and let $\textsc{Leaf}_{X_i}(v)$ denote
  the leaves of the subtree rooted at $v$ that are in the part
  $X_i$. Since the underlying graph of $\Phi$ is a tree, it follows
  that the size of $\Phi$ is bounded by a twice the number of
  leaves. For each part $X_i$, we shall show that
  $\mathrm{td}_{X_i}(f) = O(\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_{X_i}(\Phi)})$, which
  would prove the required bound. \\

  Fix an arbitrary part $Y = X_i$. Define the following three 
  sets of nodes
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    V_0 & = & \setdef{v\in \Phi}{\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_{Y}(v)} = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad \abs{\textsc{Leaf}_{Y}(\textsc{Parent}(v))} \geq 2}\\
    V_1 & = & \setdef{v\in \Phi}{\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_{Y}(v)} = 1 \quad\text{and}\quad \abs{\textsc{Leaf}_{Y}(\textsc{Parent}(v))} \geq 2}\\
    V_2 & = & \setdef{v\in \Phi}{\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_{Y}(v)} \geq 2}.
  \end{eqnarray*}

  Each node $v\in V_0$ computes a polynomial in $f_v \in
  \F[X\setminus Y]$, and we shall replace the subtree at $v$ by a node
  computing the polynomial $f_v$. Similarly, any node $v\in V_1$
  computes a polynomial of the form $f^{(0)}_v + f^{(1)}_v y_v$ for some $y_v\in Y$
  and $f^{(0)}_v, f^{(1)}_v \in \F[X\setminus Y]$. We shall again replace the
  subtree rooted at $v$ by a node computing $f^{(0)}_v + f^{(1)}_v y_v$. 

  Hence, the formula $\Phi$ now reduces to a smaller formula $\Phi_Y$ with
  leaves  being the nodes in $V_0$ and $V_1$ (and nodes in $V_2$ are
  unaffected). We would like to show that the size of the reduced
  formula, which is at most twice the number of its leaves, is
  $O(\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_Y(\Phi)})$.

  \begin{observation}\label{obs:v1-bound}$\abs{V_1} \leq \abs{\textsc{Leaf}_Y(\Phi)}$.    
  \end{observation}
  \begin{myproof}{Obs}
    Each node in $V_1$ has a distinct leaf labelled with a variable in
    $Y$. Hence, $\abs{V_1}$ is bounded by the number of leaves
    labelled with a variable in $Y$.
  \end{myproof}
  
  This shows that the $V_1$ leaves are not too many. Unfortunately, we
  cannot immediately bound the number of $V_0$ leaves, since we could
  have a long chain of $V_2$ nodes each with one sibling being a $V_0$
  leaf. The following observation would show how we can eliminate such
  long chains.

  \begin{observation}\label{obs:same-leaf-collapse}
    Let $u$ be an arbitrary node, and $v$ be another node in the
    subtree rooted at $u$ with $\textsc{Leaf}_Y(u) =
    \textsc{Leaf}_Y(v)$. Then the polynomial $g_u$ computed at $u$ and
    the polynomial $g_v$ computed at $v$ are related as $g_u = f_1 g_v
    + f_2$ for some $f_1,f_2 \in \F[X\setminus Y]$.
  \end{observation}
  \begin{myproof}{Obs}
    If $\textsc{Leaf}_Y(u) =\textsc{Leaf}_Y(v)$, then every node on
    the path from $u$ to $v$ must have a $V_0$ leaf as the other child. The
    observation follows as all these nodes are $+$ or $\times$ gates.
  \end{myproof}

  Using the above observation, we shall remove the need for $V_0$
  nodes completely by augmenting each node $u$ (computing a polynomial
  $g_u$) in $\Phi_Y$ with polynomials $f_u^{(0)}, f_u^{(1)} \in \F[X\setminus Y]$
  to enable them to compute $f_u^{(1)}g_u + f_u^{(0)}$. Let this augmented formula be called $\hat{\Phi}_Y$. Using
  Observation~\ref{obs:same-leaf-collapse}, we can now contract any
  two nodes $u$ and $v$ with $\textsc{Leaf}_Y(u) =
  \textsc{Leaf}_Y(v)$, and eliminate all $V_0$ nodes
  completely. Since all $V_2$ nodes are internal nodes, the only leaves of the augmented formula $\hat{\Phi}_Y$ are in $V_1$. Hence, the size of the augmented formula $\hat{\Phi}_Y$ is  bounded by $2\abs{V_1}$, which is bounded by
  $2\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_Y(\Phi)}$ by Observation~\ref{obs:v1-bound}.\\

  Suppose $\Phi$ computes a polynomial $f$, which can be written as  $f
  = \sum_{i=1}^t f_i\cdot m_i$ with $f_i \in \F[X\setminus Y]$ and $m_i$'s being
  distinct monomials in $Y$. Since $\hat{\Phi}_Y$ also computes $f$, each $f_i$ is a polynomial
  combination of the polynomials $S_Y = \setdef{f_{u}^{(0)},
    f_{u}^{(1)}}{u\in \hat{\Phi}_Y}$. Since $\hat{\Phi}_Y$ consists of at
  most $2\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_Y(\Phi)}$ augmented nodes, we have that
  $\mathrm{td}_Y(f) \leq |S_Y| \leq 4\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_Y(\Phi)}$. Therefore, 
  $$
  \mathrm{td}_Y(f) \quad=\quad \mathrm{trdeg}\setdef{f_i}{i\in [t]} \quad\leq\quad 4\abs{\textsc{Leaf}_Y(\Phi)}
  $$
  Hence, 
  $$\CM{Kal}(\Phi) = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathrm{td}_{X_i}(f_i) \leq 4\inparen{\sum_{i=1}^r \abs{\textsc{Leaf}_{X_i}}} = O(s).
  $$
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Lower bounding $\CM{Kal}(\Det_n)$}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:kal-lowerbound}
  Let $X = X_1 \sqcup \dots \sqcup X_n$ be the partition as defined by
  $X_t = \setdef{x_{ij}}{i-j\equiv t\bmod{n}}$. Then,
  $\CM{Kal}(\Det_n) = \Omega(n^3)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By symmetry, it is easy to see that $\text{td}_{X_i}(\Det_n)$ is
  the same for all $i$. Hence, it suffices to show that
  $\text{td}_{Y}(\Det_n) = \Omega(n^2)$ for $Y = X_n = \inbrace{x_{11},\dots, x_{nn}}$. 

  To see this, observe that the determinant consists of the monomials
  $\inparen{\frac{x_{11}\dots x_{nn}}{x_{ii}x_{jj}}}\cdot
  x_{ij}x_{ji}$ for every $i\neq j$. Hence, $\text{td}_{Y}(\Det_n)
  \geq \mathrm{trdeg}\setdef{x_{ij}x_{ji}}{i\neq j} =
  \Omega(n^2)$. Therefore, $\CM{Kal}(\Det_n) =
  \Omega(n^3)$.
\end{proof}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:kalorkoti} follows from
Lemma~\ref{lem:kal-upperbound} and Lemma~\ref{lem:kal-lowerbound}.
