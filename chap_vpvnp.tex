\chapter{Algebraic complexity classes} \label{chap-vpvnp}

Valiant \cite{v79}, in his seminal paper, defined two algebraic complexity classes that can be thought of as analogues of the boolean classes $\P$ and $\NP$. This chapter shall focus on their definitions, and some important properties related to the polynomial families $\Det_n$ and $\Perm_n$. 

\section{Definition of classes}

Recall that $\P$ is\footnote{if one is to be more precise, this is $\P/\poly$ or non-uniform $\P$. But in this article, we shall be interested only in the non-uniform versions since we shall mainly deal with circuit sizes.} the class of boolean functions that can be computed by circuits of polynomial size. An analogue of this in the arithmetic world could be polynomials $f(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ that can be computed by arithmetic circuits of size $\poly(n)$. However, such a definition would allow us to compute polynomials of very large degree. Consider a long chain of $s$ $(\times)$-gates. The output of this circuit of size $s$ is a polynomial of degree $2^s$. Valiant's definition of the algebraic analogue of $\P$ removed such ``pathological instances'' by only dealing with circuits that compute \emph{low degree polynomials}. 

\begin{definition}[Valiant's $\P$]\label{defn:vp}
The class $\VP$ refers to the set of polynomials $f(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ of \emph{degree $\poly(n)$} that can be computed by arithmetic circuits of size $\poly(n)$. 
\end{definition}

In the literature, one also encounters classes such as $\mathsf{VBP}$ and $\mathsf{VF}$ that correspond to polynomials computed by polynomial-sized ABP and formulas respectively.

\begin{remark}
The notion of \emph{degree of a circuit} is also present in the boolean domain. It is known that the class of polynomial-sized polynomial-degree boolean circuits corresponds to the class known as $\mathsf{LOGCFL}$ or $\mathsf{SAC}^1$. Thus, one could call the class $\VP$ as really an analogue of the boolean class $\mathsf{SAC}^1$. The class of exponential-degree polynomial-sized boolean circuits corresponds to $\P$. 
\end{remark}

The choice of adding a degree restriction seems natural. Most polynomial classes that we shall study will indeed by polynomials of low degree. Besides this, this restriction of degree allows some remarkable structural results for such circuits although these were \emph{a postiori}. For more on this, see this discussion on \texttt{cstheory.SE} \cite{gro:SE}. \\

Recall that the class $\NP$ may be defined as the set of all boolean functions $f(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ such that there is some $g(x_1,\dots, x_n, y_1,\dots, y_m)$ with $m = \poly(n)$ such that 
\[
f(x_1,\dots, x_n)\spaced{=} \bigvee_{\veca \in \inbrace{0,1}^m}  g(x_1,\dots, x_n, a_1,\dots, a_m)
\]
Valiant's $\NP$ is defined analogously by replacing the OR by a sum. 

\begin{definition}[Valiant's $\NP$]\label{defn:vnp}
The class $\VNP$ is defined to be the set of polynomials $f(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ such that there is some $g(x_1,\dots, g_n, y_1,\dots, y_m) \in \VP$ with $m = \poly(n)$ such that 
\[
f(x_1,\dots, x_n)\spaced{=} \sum_{\veca \in \inbrace{0,1}^m}  g(x_1,\dots, x_n, a_1,\dots, a_m)
\]
\end{definition}

It follows from definitions that $\mathsf{VF} \subseteq \mathsf{VBP} \subseteq \VP \subseteq \VNP$. It is not clear if any of the above inequalities are strict. 

\section{Some properties of these classes}

We shall state a few properties of these classes here. For a more extensive treatment, B\"{u}rgisser's book \cite{bur00} has a comprehensive study of these classes and a lot of the proofs are based on the description there. \\

Valiant~\cite{v79} presented a very useful sufficient condition to show that a given polynomial is in $\VNP$. 

\begin{theorem}[Valiant's Criterion] \label{thm:val-criterion}
Let $f = \sum_\vece c(\vece) \cdot x_1^{e_1}\dots x_n^{e_n}$. Suppose the function $\varphi$ that takes as input the exponent vector $\vece = (e_1,\dots, e_n)$ and outputs the coefficient $c(\vece)$ is in the class $\#\P/\poly$, then $f \in \VNP$. 
\end{theorem}

Thus in particular, if we compute the coefficient for a given monomial in polynomial time, then the polynomial is in $\VNP$. 

\begin{corollary}
The polynomials $\Perm_n$ and $\NW_{n,m,d}$ are in $\VNP$. 
\end{corollary}

Notice that in Definition~\ref{defn:vnp}, the polynomial $g(x_1,\dots, x_n, y_1,\dots, y_m) \in \VP$. However, a subsequent paper of Valiant showed that we may assume with loss of generality that $g \in \mathsf{VF}$, that is $g$ is computable by a small formula. This is similar to the fact that counting solutions of 3-\textsf{CNF} instance, which is a formula, is as hard as counting solutions of any polynomial sized boolean circuit. We state this result here, and a proof may be found in B\"urgisser's book. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:vnp-formula}
For any $f(x_1,\dots, x_n)\in \VNP$, there is a $g(x_1,\dots, x_n, y_1,\dots, y_m)$ that can be computed by a $\poly(n)$ sized \emph{formula} such that 
\[
f(x_1,\dots, x_n)\spaced{=} \sum_{\veca \in \inbrace{0,1}^m} g(x_1,\dots, x_n, a_1,\dots, a_m)
\]
\end{theorem}

\section{Reductions and completeness}

For polynomials, the most natural form of reductions are via \emph{projections}. We shall say that a polynomial $f$ \emph{reduces} to $g$ via projections if $g$ may be obtained by setting substituting variables of $f$ to other variables or field constants. Under such reductions, do we have natural complete polynomials for the classes $\VP$ and $\VNP$? Valiant \cite{v79} showed that the $\Det_n$ and $\Perm_n$ are (almost) complete for the classes $\VP$ and $\VNP$ respectively. We shall see the proof of this in this section. 

\begin{theorem}[\cite{v79}]\label{thm:vp}
If $f$ is a polynomial computed by an ABP of size $s$, then $f$ reduces to $\Det_n$ via projections for $n = \poly(s)$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[\cite{v79}]\label{thm:vnp}
Over any field $\F$ of characteristic not equal to $2$, the polynomial $\Perm_n$ is \emph{complete} for the class $\mathsf{VNP}$ under projections.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection*{Graph theoretic representation of $\Det_n$ and $\Perm_n$}

Let us think of an $n\times n$ symbolic matrix as an adjacency matrix of a directed graph $G$ with the edge from $i$ to $j$ having weight $x_{ij}$. Then every monomial of $\Det_n$ or $\Perm_n$ corresponds to a permutation $\sigma$, and the corresponding edges in the graph $G$ form a \emph{cycle cover} i.e. a partition of the vertices of $G$ into disjoint cycles. The weight of a cycle-cover shall be defined as the product of weights of the edges constituting the cycles, and the sign of the cycle cover shall be the sign of the permutation $\sigma$. This allows us to write $\Det_n$ and $\Perm_n$ as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\det(G) & = & \sum_{C\in \mathrm{CycleCovers}(G)} wt(C) \cdot \mathrm{sign}(C)\\
\mathrm{perm}(G) & = & \sum_{C\in \mathrm{CycleCovers}(G)} wt(C) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{ABPs reduce to $\Det_n$}

We shall now show that for any $f$ computable by an ABP, there is a matrix  $A$ each of whose entries are either variables of constants such that $\det(A) = f$. Since any ABP is a projection of the polynomial $\IMM_{n,d}$, we shall show that we can construct a matrix  $A$  such that $\det(A) = \IMM_{n,d}$. \\

Consider the graph $G$ underlying the ABP that corresponds to the polynomial $\IMM_{n,d}$. Let $s$ and $t$ be the unique source and sink vertices respectively. Every path from $s\leadsto t$ corresponds to a single monomial of $\IMM_{n,d}$ of degree $d$. We shall now modify the graph slightly such that each such $s\leadsto t$ path would map to a unique cycle cover:

\begin{quote}
  To the graph $G$, add an edge with weight $1$ from $t$ to $s$. 

  Further, for all nodes except $s$ and $t$, add a self-loop of weight $1$. 
\end{quote}

Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of this new graph $G'$. The claim is that $\det(A)$ is either $\IMM_{n,d}$ or $\IMM_{n,d}$. To see this observe that all cycle covers of $G'$ must consist of a single $s\leadsto t$ path that loops back to $s$ via the edge $t\rightarrow s$ that we added, and self-loops on all excluded vertices. Further, since all $s\leadsto t$ paths in $G$ were of the same length, it is easy to check that all the cycle covers have the same sign. Thus $\IMM_{n,d}$ does indeed reduce to $\Det_m$ for $m = \poly(n)$. \qed {\footnotesize (Theorem~\ref{thm:vp})}\\


\subsection{$\Det_n$ can be computed by ABPs}

A result that is often stated but not proved explicitly is a polynomial sized circuit for $\Det_n$. This is often attributed by Berkowitz \cite{Berk84}. In fact, $\Det_n$ in fact has a polynomial sized ABP and this construction is due to Mahajan and Vinay~\cite{mv97} based on \emph{clow sequences}. The construction is really neat and we shall describe the ABP explicitly here. Although we will not give the full proof of the correctness Mahajan-Vinay construction, we shall give some intuition to understand the construction better. 

\[
\Det_n \spaced{=} \abs{\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & \dots & x_{n1}\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n1} & \dots & x_{nn}
\end{array}
}\]

If the symbolic matrix on the RHS is the adjacency matrix of an $n$-vertex graph, then the determinant is just the sum of weighted signed cycle-covers of the graph. A natural approach compute this via an ABP is to somehow compute each cycle cover on one path of the ABP. Unfortunately, if one were to try the \naive approach of building a cycle cover over many layers, to decide what our next vertex should be we are forced to remember the entire partial construction thus far. This ends up yielding an ABP with super-polynomial width (the width intuitively corresponds to the memory required). 

The key insight of Mahajan and Vinay was to relax the notion of cycle covers to something weaker that can be built with less memory, to what they called \emph{clow sequences}. 

\begin{definition}[Clow Sequences]
Label the vertices of the graph as $1,\dots, n$. A clow  of length $\ell$ is a closed walk on the graph $G$ of length $\ell$ such as $v_1,\dots, v_\ell,v_1$ such that $v_1 < v_i$ for all $i=2,\dots, \ell$. We shall also refer to $v_1$ as the \emph{head of the clow}. 

In other words, the head of a clow is the smallest vertex of the walk, and the head does not repeat in a clow (although other vertices can). 

A clow sequence is a sequence of clows $(C_1,\dots, C_r)$ that additionally satisfy $\mathrm{head}(C_1) < \dots < \mathrm{head}(C_r)$. 

The length of a clow sequence is the sum of the lengths of the clows that it comprises of. The weight of a clow sequence is just the product of weights of the edges it comprises of. Also, the sign of a clow sequence of length $\ell$ that comprises of $r$ clows is $(-1)^{\ell + r}$. 
\end{definition}

Any cycle cover is of course a clow sequence. Further, the sign of the cycle cover matches the above definition of the sign of a clow sequence. But there are many clow sequences that visit some vertices multiple times, and hence not cycle covers. However, Mahajan and Vinay show that the sum of signed-weights of all clow sequences also yields the determinant. 

\begin{theorem}[\cite{mv97}] If $A_G$ is the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$, then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\det(A_G) & = &  \sum_{C \in \mathrm{CycleCover(G)}} wt(C) \cdot \mathrm{sign}(C) \spaced{=} \det(A_G)\\
& = & \sum_{C \in \mathrm{ClowSequence(G)}} wt(C) \cdot \mathrm{sign}(C)
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{theorem}

They prove this by showing that the set of clow sequences that are not cycle covers can partitioned into pairs $(C_1,C_2)$ such that $wt(C_1) = wt(C_2)$ and $\mathrm{sign}(C_1) = - \mathrm{sign}(C_2)$. \\

We are now ready to describe the ABP. The ABP consists of $n+1$ layers labelled as layer $1,\dots, n+1$. Besides layer $1$ and $n+1$, every other layer $\ell$ consists of $\Omega(n^2)$ nodes that we shall label as $v_{i,j}^{(\ell)}$ for $1\leq i\leq j\leq n$. It is best to think of $i$ as representing the \emph{head of the current clow}, and $j$ as the \emph{current vertex in the clow}. 

The first layer consists of a single vertex that we shall call $s = v_{1,1}^{(1)}$ (to maintain the same notation)  and the last layer consists of a single vertex that we shall call $t$. The edges between layers, and the weights are defined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each node $v_{i,j}^{(\ell)}$ in layer $\ell \in [n]$, there is an edge to vertex $v_{i,k}^{(\ell+1)}$ for every $k > i$. The weight of this edge is $x_{jk}$. 

(This is like adding vertex $k > i$ to our current clow by taking edge $x_{jk}$. The head continues to be $i$, and the current vertex is now $k$. )
\item For each node $v_{i,j}^{(\ell)}$ in layer $\ell \in [n]$, there is an edge to vertex $v_{k,k}^{(\ell+1)}$ for every $k > i$. The weight of this edge is $(-x_{ji})$. 

(This is like ending the current clow by taking edge $x_{ji}$ back to the head, and starting a new clow with head as $k$. Thus, the head of the current clow is $k$, and the current vertex is also $k$. In this process, we increased the number of clows in the sequence by 1 and hence the weight being $(-x_{ji})$ accounts for the sign change as well.)

\item For the last layer, each node $v_{i,j}^{(n)}$ has an edge to $t$ with weight $(-x_{ji})$. 

(This just corresponds to ending the last clow in our sequence.)
\end{enumerate}


\noindent
Summarizing this as a theorem, we have:

\begin{theorem}[\cite{mv97}]\label{thm:det-abp}
The polynomial $\Det_n$ can be computed by an ABP of size $\Omega(n^3)$ over any field $\F$. Thus, in particular, $\Det_n$ can be computed by a arithmetic circuit of size $\poly(n)$. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Completeness of the permanent}

The $\VNP$ completeness for the permanent is trickier, and uses a very clever gadget. The proof described here is a modification of the proof in B\"urgisser's book \cite{bur00}. This is the simplest proof that I am aware of currently. \\

Let $f(x_1,\dots, x_n) = \sum_\veca g(x_1,\dots, x_n, a_1,\dots, a_m)$ be in $\VNP$ with $g(\vecx, \vecy)$ computable by a formula of size $s$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:vnp-formula}). Like in the previous section, we can construct a graph $G$ (with weights being either scalars or variables in $\vecx$ or $\vecy$) such that the sum of weighted cycle covers is equal to $g(\vecx, \vecy)$. The goal is to now compute $\sum_\veca g(\vecx, \veca)$. \\

Let us consider a simpler case, where there is a variable $y \in \vecy$ such that there is just one edge in $e_y \in G$ with weight $y$. Can we transform the graph $G$ locally to compute $g' = g_{(y=0)} + g_{(y=1)}$? Note that since $y$ occurs only once in $G$, we have that $g = y \cdot g_1 + g_0$ where $g_1$ and $g_0$ are independent of $y$. Thus, the polynomial $g'$ can be written as $g_1 + 2 g_0$. One way to compute this is to transform the graph $G$ so that any cycle-cover of $G$ that includes the edge $e_y$ has the same weight as before, but every cycle-cover that does not include the edge $e_y$ has its weight multiplied by $2$. This can be achieved by splitting the edge $e_y$ in the middle with a new vertex $v$ with a self-loop of weight $2$:

\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,thick,main node/.style={circle,fill=blue!20,draw}]
\node[main node] (u) at (0,0) {};
\node[main node] (v) at (2,0) {}
edge[<-] node[above] {$y$} (u);
\node (arrow) at (4,0) {\Large $\leadsto$};
\node[main node] (u1) at (6,0) {};
\node[main node] (u2) at (7,0) {}
edge[<-] (u1);
\node[main node] (v1) at (8,0) {}
edge[<-] (u2);
\path[every node/.style={font=\tiny}] (u2) edge [loop above] node {2} (u2);
\end{tikzpicture}

Clearly, any cycle-cover that uses the edge $e_y$ has the same weight, and all other cycle-covers are forced to take the self-loop around the added vertex of weight $2$. This allows us to handle graphs $G$ where every variable $y \in \vecy$ occurs only once in $G$. The complication arises because there could be multiple edges that has the label $y$. We want a way by which we can say that all cycle covers that choose \emph{any} of the $y$-edges have the same weight, but cycle-covers that do not pick any $y$-edge have weight multiplied by $2$. The following is a gadget that has similar properties, called \emph{rosette}. The diagram below represents the $4$-rosette. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,thick,main node/.style={circle,fill=blue!20,draw}]
\node[main node] (v1) at (0,0) {};
\node[main node] (v2) at (2,0) {};
\node[main node] (v3) at (2,2) {};
\node[main node] (v4) at (0,2) {};

\path[every node/.style={font=\tiny},ultra thick] (v1) edge (v2)
(v2) edge (v3)
(v3) edge (v4)
(v4) edge (v1);

\node[main node] (l1) at (1,-1) {};
\node[main node] (l2) at (3,1) {};
\node[main node] (l3) at (1,3) {};
\node[main node] (l4) at (-1,1) {};

\path[every node/.style={font=\tiny},thick] (l1) edge (v2)
edge [loop below] (l1)
(v2) edge (l2)
(l2) edge[loop right] (l2)
(l2) edge (v3)
(v3) edge (l3)
(l3) edge [loop above] (l3)
(l3) edge (v4)
(v4) edge (l4)
(l4) edge [loop left] (l4)
(l4) edge (v1) 
(v1) edge (l1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The thick edges in the above picture shall be called \emph{connector edges} (this shall play the role of the $y$-edges). Note that the rosette has the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any non-empty subset $S$ of the connector edges, there is exactly one cycle-cover of the rosette that includes exactly the set $S$ fo the connector-edges. 
\item There are exactly two cycle-covers of the rosette that do not include any connector edge. 
\end{enumerate}
Thus, if we could somehow ``glue'' the connector edges with our $y$-edges, we would be done. This is achieved by yet another gadget that we shall call the \emph{glue gadget}. The following is the description of the glue gadget that glues edges $(u,v)$ and $(u',v')$ by adding three additional vertices. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,thick,main node/.style={circle,fill=blue!20,draw}]
\node[main node] (u) at (0,0) {};
\node (lu) at (0,-0.5) {$u$};
\node[main node] (v) at (6,0) {};
\node (lu) at (6,-0.5) {$v$};

\node[main node] (u1) at (0,2) {};
\node (lu1) at (0,1.5) {$u'$};

\node[main node] (v1) at (6,2) {};
\node (lv1) at (6,1.5) {$v'$};

\node[main node] (p1) at (2,0) {};
\node at (2,0) {\tiny $p_1$};

\node[main node] (p2) at (4,0) {};
\node at (4,0) {\tiny $p_2$};

\node[main node] (p3) at (3,2) {};
\node at (3,2) {\tiny $p_3$};

\path[every node/.style={font=\tiny},thick] (u) edge (p1)
(p1) edge [bend left] (p2)
(p2) edge (v)
(u1) edge (p3)
(p3) edge (v1)
(p3) edge [loop above] node {$-1/2$} (p3)
(p1) edge [bend left=20] node {$1/2$} (p3)
(p2) edge [bend right=20] node [above right] {$-1/2$} (p3)
(p3) edge [bend left=20] (p1)
(p3) edge [bend right=20] (p2)
(p1) edge [loop below] node {$-1$} (p1)
(p2) edge [loop below] node {$1$} (p2)
edge [bend left=20] (p1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The adjacency matrix between the nodes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ is 
\[
A = \insquare{\begin{array}{rrr}
-1 & 1 & 1/2\\
1 & 1 & -1/2\\
1 & 1 & -1/2
\end{array}}
\]

\noindent
\begin{claim}
Let $(u,v)$ and $(u',v')$ be two edges of a graph $G$, and let $G'$ be the graph with the glue gadget between them as described above. Then $\mathrm{perm}(G')$ equals the sum of all weighted cycle covers of $G$ that either include both $(u,v)$ and $(u',v')$ in it or neither. 
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
If both edges $(u,v)$ and $(u',v')$ are taken in the cycle cover, this is realised in $G'$ as ${(\cdots u,p_1, p_2, v \cdots) (\cdots u', p_3, v' \cdots)}$, which has the same weight.  

If neither of the edges $(u,v)$ and $(u',v')$ are taken in the cycle cover, then the total contribution of all cycle covers of $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ is $\mathrm{perm}(A) = 1$. 

If the edge $(u,v)$ is taken but $(u',v')$ is not, then the edge $(u,v)$ can be realised in $G'$ as either $\inbrace{(\cdots u,p_1,p_2,v \cdots) (p_3)}$ or $\inbrace{(\cdots u,p_1,p_3,p_2,v \cdots )}$. The total contribution is therefore zero. 

Similarly, if the edge $(u',v')$ is taken but not $(u,v)$, then this can be realised in $G'$ as $\inbrace{(\cdots u',p_3,v' \cdots),(p_1,p_2)}$ and $\inbrace{(\cdots u',p_3, v' \cdots) (p_1) (p_2)}$. Again, the net contribution is zero.  
\end{proof}

Now with these two gadgets, we are done. For every variable $y_i \in \vecy$, let $e_{i,1}, \dots, e_{i,r_i}$ be the edges labelled with $y$. Let $R_i$ be a $r_i$-rosette disjoint from the graph $G$ The graph $G'$ is built as follows:
\begin{quote}
  Take a disjoint union of $G$ with one $r_i$-rosette for each $i = 1,\dots, m$. 

  Glue each edge labelled with $y_i$ with the $r_i$ connector edges in the $r_i$-rosette. 
\end{quote}

It should be easy to see that $\mathrm{perm}(G) = \sum_{\veca} g(\vecx, \veca)$. This completes the proof of the $\VNP$-completeness of $\Perm_n$. \qed {\footnotesize (Theorem~\ref{thm:vnp})} \\

Note that we needed to divide by $2$ in the glue gadget. This is why we require the characteristic of the field to be different from two for the above proof to work.
