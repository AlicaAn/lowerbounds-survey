\chapter{Lower bounds for non-homogeneous depth three circuits, and beyond}

In a very recent result, Kayal and Saha~\cite{KayalSaha14} show that similar
techniques can also be used to prove lower bounds for subclasses of
non-homogeneous depth three circuits, 
namely depth three circuits with \emph{bounded bottom fan-in}. 
We shall denote the class of depth three circuits of bottom fan-in bounded by $r$ as $\SPS^{[r]}$ circuits. 
The ideas involved have also been useful in addressing depth-$4$ circuits
with ``low-arity'' \cite{KumarSaraf15,KayalSaha15}.

But before we see this lower bound, let us first understand the
computational power of depth three circuits, and the depth reduction
of \cite{gkks13b} as the ideas there are central for these lower
bounds.

\section{Computational power of depth three circuits}\label{sec:depth-3-red}

A $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit computes a polynomial of the form
\[
f\quad=\quad \sum_{i=1}^s \ell_{i1}\dots \ell_{iD}
\]
If the circuit is non-homogeneous, the degree of the circuit $D$ could potentially be much larger than $\deg(f)$. \\

The class of depth three arithmetic circuits can compute polynomials in non-trivial ways. To illustrate a couple of examples, there is a homogeneous $\SPS$ circuit for $\Perm_n$ of size $2^{O(n)}$ called Ryser's Formula \cite{rys63}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ryser}
\Perm_n \spaced{=} \sum_{S \subseteq[n]} (-1)^{n - |S|} \prod_{i=1}^n \inparen{\sum_{j\in S} x_{ij}}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, no $\SPS$ circuit for the $\Det_n$ significantly better than writing it as a sum of $n!$ monomials was known (until \cite{gkks13b}). 
Further, the elementary symmetric polynomials $\ESym_k(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ of degree $k$ defined as
\[
\ESym_k(\vecx) \spaced{=} \sum_{\substack{S\subset \vecx\\|S| = k}} \prod_{x_i\in S}x_i
\]
can be computed by a non-homogeneous depth $3$ circuit of size $O(n^2)$ over any characteristic zero field. In stark contrast, \cite{nw1997} showed that any homogeneous depth $3$ circuit computing $\ESym_k$ requires size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. \cite{nw1997} also showed a $2^{\Omega(n)}$ lower bound for homogeneous depth $3$ circuits computing $\Perm_n$ or $\Det_n$. 

Also, the results of \cite{gr00,grigoriev98} showed a $2^{\Omega(n)}$ lower bound for $\SPS$ circuits \emph{over finite fields} that compute $\Det_n$ or $\Perm_n$. All these results seemed to suggest that there perhaps is an $2^{\Omega(n)}$ 
lower bound for $\SPS$ circuits computing $\Det_n$ over characteristic zero fields as well. If it was true over finite fields, and for homogeneous $\SPS$ circuits, how much power can characteristic zero fields and non-homogeneity add? As it turns out, quite a lot!

\begin{theorem}[\cite{gkks13b}] \label{thm:chasm-at-3}
Let $f$ be an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial computed by an arithmetic circuit of size $s$ over any characteristic zero field. Then there is a $\SPS$ circuit of size $s' \leq s^{O(\sqrt{d})}$ that computes $f$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}[\cite{gkks13b}]\label{cor:det-sps}
There is a $\SPS$ circuit over $\Q$, the field of rational numbers, of size $n^{O(\sqrt{n})}$. 
\end{corollary}

The proof is quite short and comprises of two steps using known reductions, and going through a bizarre intermediate model of \emph{depth $5$ powering circuits}. Simply presenting the proof step-by-step would rob the readers of the intuition as to why one would study depth $5$ powering circuits. This result was really a bi-product of an attempt to prove a stronger lower bound for depth $4$ circuits. We believe this perspective, albeit lengthier, is more insightful than seeing the proof directly. 

\subsubsection{Towards proving better lower bounds for depth $4$ circuits}

From \autoref{thm:av}, it suffices to prove a better lower bound for explicit polynomials computed as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:d4-LB}
f\spaced{=} \sum_{i=1}^s Q_{i1}\dots Q_{ir} \quad\text{where}\quad \deg(Q_{ij})\leq \sqrt{d}\;,\; r\leq O(\sqrt{d})
\end{equation}
The goal is to show a lower bound of $s = n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Perhaps a simpler question to ask is to prove a lower bound for expressions of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:d4pow-LB}
f\spaced{=} \sum_{i=1}^s Q_{i}^{\sqrt{d}} \quad\text{where }\deg(Q_i)\leq \sqrt{d}
\end{equation}
Fortunately, if the goal is to prove lower bounds of $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$, then without loss of generality we can focus on this equation instead! 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:fischer}
Over any characteristic zero field, given an expression of the form 
\[
f\spaced{=} \sum_{i=1}^s Q_{i1}\dots Q_{ir} \quad\text{where}\quad \deg(Q_{ij})\leq \sqrt{d}\;,\; r\leq O(\sqrt{d})
\]
there is an equivalent equation
\[
f\spaced{=} \sum_{i=1}^{s'} Q_{i}^r\quad\text{where}\quad \deg(Q_{i})\leq \sqrt{d}
\]
with $s' \leq s \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{r})}$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider Ryser's formula (\ref{eqn:ryser}) applied for to the $r\times r$ matrix where each row is $[y_1,\dots, y_r]$. 
\[
\Perm \insquare{\begin{array}{ccc} y_1 & \dots & y_r\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ y_1 & \dots & y_r\end{array}} \quad = \quad r! \cdot y_1\dots y_r \quad = \quad \sum_{S\subseteq [r]} \inparen{\sum_{j\in S} y_j}^n
\]
The lemma follows by applying this identity on each term $Q_{i1}\dots Q_{ir}$. 
\end{proof}

A very similar identity, to convert a product into sums of powers of linear polynomials, is often attributed to Fischer \cite{fischer}. We shall refer to this as the Ryser-Fischer trick. 

\begin{lemma}[Ryser-Fischer Trick]\label{lem:ryser-fischer}
$$y_1 \dots y_r  = \frac{1}{r!} \cdot \sum_{S\subseteq [r]} \inparen{\sum_{j\in S} y_j}^n$$
\end{lemma}

Note that since we need to divide by $r!$, the above lemma fails over low characteristic fields, in particular finite fields. Thus, proving an $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$ lower bound for expressions such as (\ref{eqn:d4pow-LB}) implies an $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$ lower bound for expressions such as (\ref{eqn:d4-LB}). We shall call expressions such as (\ref{eqn:d4pow-LB}) as $\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma\Pi^{[\sqrt{d}]}$ circuits. 

Just as we converted the top $\Pi$ layer into powering layers using the Ryser-Fischer identity, the same can be done to the lower layer of $\Pi$ gates as well.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:pow-genckt}
If a homogeneous $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial $f$ can be computed by a $\SPSPfanin{O(\sqrt{d})}{\sqrt{d}}$ of size $s = n^{O(\sqrt{d})}$, then $f$ can also be computed by an $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge^{[O(\sqrt{d})]}}\Sigma\mathord{\wedge^{[\sqrt{d}]}}\Sigma$ circuit of size $s' = s \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{d})}$. 

Conversely, if $f$ requires $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge^{[O(\sqrt{d})]}}\Sigma\mathord{\wedge^{[\sqrt{d}]}}\Sigma$ circuits of size $s' = n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$ to compute it, then $f$ cannot be computed by polynomial sized arithmetic circuits. 
\end{corollary}

We shall take a small detour to see if non-homogeneous depth $3$ circuits can be converted to homogeneous shallow circuits without much blow-up in size.

\subsubsection{Non-homogeneous depth $3$ to homogeneous depth $5$ circuits}

Let $f$ be a homogeneous degree $d$ polynomial computed by a possibly non-homogeneous depth $3$ circuit $C$ of the form
\[
f\quad=\quad \sum_{i=1}^s \ell_{i1}\dots \ell_{iD}
\]
As a first step, let us extract the degree $d$ homogeneous component of each summand on the RHS. Since $f$ is a homogeneous degree $d$ polynomial, $f$ has to be sum of the degree $d$ homogeneous components of each summand on the RHS. Consider a single term of the form
\[
T \spaced{=} (\ell_1 + \alpha_1)\cdots (\ell_D + \alpha_D)
\]
where each $\ell_i$ is a homogeneous linear polynomial, and $\alpha$ are elements from the field. Assuming that the first $r$ of the $\alpha_i$'s are zero, we can write $T$ in the form (with some reuse of symbols)
\begin{eqnarray*}
T & = &  \alpha \cdot \ell_1\dots \ell_r \cdot (\ell_{r+1} + 1)\dots (\ell_D+1)\\
\implies \quad \mathrm{Hom}_d(T) & = & \ell_1 \dots \ell_r \cdot \ESym_{d-r}(\ell_{r+1}, \dots, \ell_D)
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\ESym_{k}(\vecx)$, the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree $k$ defined as
\[
\ESym_k(\vecx) \spaced{=} \sum_{\substack{S\subset \vecx\\|S| = k}} \prod_{x_i\in S}x_i
\]
Hence, if we can show that $\ESym_{d-r}(\vecx)$ has a not-too-large homogeneous depth $4$ circuit, then we can immediately infer that $f$ can be computed by a not-too-large homogeneous depth $5$ circuit. The following identities, attributed to Newton (cf. \cite{kalman00}), is exactly what we need. Define the \emph{power symmetric polynomials}, denoted by $\mathrm{Pow}_k(\vecx)$ as
\[
\mathrm{Pow}_k(\vecx) \quad = \quad \sum_{x_i \in \vecx} x_i^k
\]

\begin{lemma}[Newton Identities]\label{lem:newton-identities}
  Let $\ESym_k(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$ and $\PSym_k(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$ denote
  the \emph{elementary symmetric} and \emph{power symmetric} polynomials of degree
  $k$ respectively, as defined above. Then,
  $$
  \ESym_k\spaced{=}\frac{1}{k!} \cdot 
  \begin{vmatrix}\PSym_1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0\\ 
    \PSym_2 & \PSym_1 & 2 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\ 
    \vdots& \vdots & \ddots & \ddots &  & \vdots \\
    \vdots& \vdots &  & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \PSym_{k-1} & \PSym_{k-2} & \PSym_{k-3}& \cdots & \PSym_1 & k-1 \\ 
    \PSym_k & \PSym_{k-1} & \PSym_{k-2} & \cdots & \PSym_2 & \PSym_1 
  \end{vmatrix}.
  $$
\end{lemma}

Expanding the determinant on the RHS, we obtain a homogeneous expression
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:esym}
\ESym_k(\vecx) \quad = \quad \sum_{\veca\;:\; \sum_i ia_i = k} \alpha_\veca \cdot (\PSym_1)^{a_1}\dots (\PSym_k)^{a_k}
\end{equation}
The number of summands bounded by the number of non-negative solutions to $\sum i a_i = k$ , which is precisely the number of partitions of $k$. By the estimates of \cite{hr18}, we know that the number of partitions of $k$ is bounded by $2^{\Theta(\sqrt{k})}$. Thus, (\ref{eqn:esym}) yields a homogeneous depth $4$ circuit for $\ESym_k(x_1,\dots, x_m)$ of size $2^{\Theta(\sqrt{k})} \cdot m$. In fact, the circuit is a homogeneous $\SPSE$ circuit, i.e. a $\SPSP$ circuit where the bottom layer of multiplication in fact just raises a single variable to a higher power. 

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:d3-d5}
Let $T$ be a product of $D$ linear polynomials over $n$ variables, not necessarily homogeneous. Then, the degree $d$ homogeneous component of $T$, denoted by $\mathrm{Hom}_d(T)$ can be computed by a homogeneous $\SPSE$ circuit of size $nD\cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{d})}$. 

Hence, if $f$ is a homogeneous degree $d$ polynomial over $n$ variables that is computed by a non-homogeneous depth $3$ circuit $C$ of size $s$, then $f$ can be computed by a homogeneous $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit of size $\poly(ns) \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{d})}$. 
\end{corollary}

To convert the $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit to a $\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit, we could use Ryser-Fischer's identity again. At first sight, it appears as though this would yield a blow up of $2^d$ as some of the product gates could have fan-in $d$. However, notice that the sum is over $a_i$'s satisfying $\sum i\cdot a_i = d$. Hence, there can be at most $O(\sqrt{d})$ of the $a_i$'s that are non-zero. By looking at Ryser-Fischer's identity applied on $y_1^{a_1}\dots y_{d}^{a_d}$ more carefully, we see that it uses at most $(1+a_1)\dots (1+a_d) \leq d^{O(\sqrt{d})}$ distinct linear powers instead of the \naive bound of $2^{d}$. This fact of expressing any degree $d$ monomial over $m$ variables as a $\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit of size $d^{O(m)}$ was also observed by Ellison \cite{ellison}. 

Thus, if $f$ admits a poly-sized depth three circuit, then $f$ also admits a homogeneous $\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit of size $d^{O(\sqrt{d})} \cdot \poly(n)$. The following lemma summarizes this discussion. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:pow-depth3}
Let $f$ be an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial that is computable by depth three circuit of size $s$ over $\Q$. Then, $f$ is equivalently computable by a homogeneous $\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit of size $d^{O(\sqrt{d})}\cdot \poly(s)$. 

Conversely, if $f$ requires $\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuits of size $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$ over $\Q$ to compute it, then $f$ requires depth three circuits of size $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$. 
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Completing the picture}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (SESES) at (0,0) {$\begin{array}{c}n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})} \text{ LB} \\\text{ for } \SESES \text{ circuits}\end{array}$};
\node (genCkt) at (-2.5,-2) {$\begin{array}{c} n^{\omega(1)} \text{ LB} \\ \text{ for general circuits} \end{array}$}

\node[text=gray] at (0,-1.7) {??};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{Power of $\SESES$ ckts.}
\label{fig:SESES}
\end{figure}


We now have an interesting situation (\autoref{fig:SESES}). On one hand, \autoref{cor:pow-genckt} states that a lower bound of $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$ for $\SESES$ circuits would yield a super-polynomial lower bound for general arithmetic circuits. On the other, \autoref{lem:pow-depth3} states that an $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$ lower bound for $\SESES$ circuits would yield a lower bound of $n^{\omega(\sqrt{d})}$ for depth three circuits. 

Could this just be a coincidence? Or, is it the case that any poly-sized arithmetic circuit can be equivalently expressed as a depth three circuit of size $n^{O(\sqrt{d})}$ over $\Q$? As it turns out, there is indeed a depth reduction to convert any arithmetic circuit to a not-too-large depth three circuit over $\Q$. \\

To complete the picture, it suffices to show that a $\mywedge\Sigma\mywedge$ circuit can be expressed as a $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit. This would automatically imply a reduction from $\SESES$ circuits to $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuits. The last step of the puzzle is the \emph{duality trick} of \cite{sax08}. 

\begin{lemma}[The Duality Trick \cite{sax08}]\label{lem:duality} There exists univariate polynomials $f_{ij}$'s of degree at most $b$ such that
$$
\inparen{z_1 + \dots + z_s}^b \quad = \quad \sum_{i=1}^{sb+1} f_{i1}(z_1)\dots f_{is}(z_s).
$$
\end{lemma}

It is worth noting that the degree of each term on the RHS is $sb$, whereas the LHS just has degree $b$. This is the place where non-homogeneity is introduced. Applying the above lemma for a $\mywedge\Sigma\mywedge$ circuit such as $(y_1^a + \dots + y_s^a)^b$ gives

\begin{eqnarray*}
(y_1^a + \dots + y_s^a)^b & = & \sum_{i=1}^{sb+1} \prod_{j=1}^s f_{ij}(y_j^a)\\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{sb+1} \prod_{j=1}^s \tilde{f}_{ij}(y_j)
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\tilde{f}_{ij}(y) = f_{ij}(y^a)$. Since each $\tilde{f}_{ij}(y)$ is a univariate polynomial, it can be factorized completely over the $\C$, the field of complex numbers. Hence, if $f_{ij}(y) = \prod_k (y - \zeta_{ijk})$, then we get
\begin{eqnarray*}
(y_1^a + \dots + y_s^a)^b & = & \sum_{i=1}^{sb+1} \prod_{j=1}^s \tilde{f}_{ij}(y_j)\\
&= & \sum_{i=1}^{sb+1} \prod_{j=1}^s \prod_{k=1}^b (y_j - \zeta_{ijk})\\
\end{eqnarray*}
which is a depth three circuit! Thus, $(y_1^a + \dots + y_s^a)$ can be expressed as a depth three circuit of size $\poly(s,a,b)$ over $\C$. With a little more effort, one can construct a depth three circuit over $\Q$ as well. Summarizing this is a lemma, we have the following. 

\begin{lemma}
Any $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial $f$ computed by a homogeneous $\SESES$ of size $s$ over a characteristic zero field $\F$ can also be computed by a depth three circuit of size $\poly(s,n,d)$ over $\F$. 
\end{lemma}

Combining with \autoref{cor:pow-genckt} and \autoref{thm:av}, we obtain the main result of \cite{gkks13b}. \\

\noindent
{\bf \autoref{thm:chasm-at-3} (restated). }{\em 
Let $f$ be an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial computed by an arithmetic circuit of size $s$ over any characteristic zero field. Then there is a $\SPS$ circuit of size $s' \leq s^{O(\sqrt{d})}$ that computes $f$. 
}\\

{\bf Remark. } Note that if we were to start with a degree $d$ polynomial $f$ and apply the above depth reduction, all the linear polynomials that we obtain at bottom are essentially from the application of Ryser-Fischer's identity on the bottom $\Pi$ layer of fanin $\sqrt{d}$ of the $\SPSPfanin{O(\sqrt{d})}{\sqrt{d}}$ circuit. Hence, the each of the linear polynomials that appear in the final $\SPS$ circuit depend on at most $\sqrt{d}$ variables. In other words, the above Theorem yields a reduction to $\SPS^{[\sqrt{d}]}$ circuits. 

\subsection{Lower bounds for $\SPS$ circuits with small bottom fan-in}

Now let us focus on $\SPS^{[r]}$ circuits, where all linear polynomials in the circuit depend on at most $r$ variables. The following is the key observation of \cite{KayalSaha14} and can be verified easily. 

\begin{observation}[\cite{KayalSaha14}]
Starting with a $\SPS^{[r]}$ circuit $C$ of size $s$ computing a homogeneous $n$-variate polynomial of degree $d$, the resulting $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit $C'$ obtained from \autoref{cor:d3-d5} is in fact a 
$\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma^{[r]}$ circuit of size $s' = \poly(ns) \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{d})}$. 

Thus, by expanding the all powers of linear polynomials computed in the bottom two layers of the $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\mywedge\Sigma$ circuit $C'$, the circuit $C'$ can be rewritten as a homogeneous depth $4$ circuit of bottom support bounded by $r$ and  size $s'' = s' \cdot d^r$
\end{observation}

This observation in combination with \autoref{thm:KLSS-lowsupp} immediately yields the main theorem of \cite{KayalSaha14}. 

\begin{theorem}[\cite{KayalSaha14}]\label{thm:kaysaha-main}
Over any characteristic zero field $\F$, any $\SPS^{[r]}$ circuit $C$ computing the polynomial $\IMM_{n,d}$, for suitably chosen parameters $n$ and $d$ with $n = d^{O(1)}$, must have size $s = n^{\Omega(d/r)}$. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Extensions to low-bottom-fanin depth $5$ circuits}

\cite{KayalSaha14} also prove lower bounds for depth $5$ circuits where the bottom fan-in is bounded. The result proceeds by analysing the random restriction process carefully to decompose any $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi\Sigma^{[\tau]}$ circuit into a $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\sqrt{d}]}$ circuit and another circuit $C'$ such that $\Gamma_{k,\ell}^{[\mathrm{PSD}]}(C') = 0$. We just state their theorem here without proof. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:kaysaha-d5}
Let $\F$ be a field of characteristic zero, and let $0\leq \mu < 1$. If $\alpha  = \frac{2\mu + 1}{1 - \mu}$ and $\tau = O(N^\mu)$, then there is a family of $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomials $\inbrace{f_n}$ in $\VNP$ with $n\in [d^{2+\alpha}, 2d^{2+\alpha}]$ such that any homogeneous $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi\Sigma^{[\tau]}$ circuit computing this polynomial requires size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. 
\end{theorem}
