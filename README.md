lowerbounds-survey
==================

A survey of known lower bounds in arithmetic circuits. 

The goal is to keep populating this survery with lower bounds in arithmetic circuits. So far, there were two surveys that I was a part of (one with Neeraj Kayal, that appeared in the Special Volume for Somenath Biswas' 60th Birthday, and another by just myself that appeared in the EATCS bulletin). Hopefully this would continue to remain a comprehensive survey of all known lowerbounds in arithmetic circuit complexity. 

Perhaps other people can contribute to this too (if I can convince them to!)
